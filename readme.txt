== Description ==

**ATTENTION: TablePress is absolute ALPHA software right now. Use at your own risk. No support will be provided yet!**

TablePress enables you to create and manage tables on your WordPress site. No HTML knowledge is needed, as a comfortable interface allows to easily edit table data. Tables can contain any type of data, even formulas that will be evaluated. An additional JavaScript library can be used to add features like sorting, pagination, filtering, and more for site visitors. You can include the tables into your posts, on your pages, or in text widgets with ease. Tables can be imported and exported from/to CSV files (e.g. from Excel), HTML files, and JSON.

== Installation ==

The easiest way to install TablePress is via your WordPress Dashboard. Go to the "Plugins" section and search for "TablePress" in the WordPress Plugin Directory. Then you can click "Install" and the following steps will be done for you automatically. You'll just have to activate the plugin (step 5).

Manual Installation works just as for most other WordPress plugins:

1. Download and extract the zip file and just drop the folder "tablepress" into the "wp-content/plugins/" directory of your WordPress installation.

1. Activate the plugin "TablePress" on your "Plugins" page.

1. Create and manage tables by going to the "TablePress" section in the admin menu.

1. Add a table to a page, post, or text widget, by adding the Shortcode `[table id=&lt;your-table's-id&gt; /]` to its content.

1. You can change the table styling by using CSS code, which can be entered into the "Custom CSS" textarea on the "Plugin Options" screen.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find answers to Frequently Asked Questions? =

A wide group of questions, regarding different features or styling has been answered in the [FAQ section](http://tablepress.org/faq/) on the plugin website.

= Support? =

For support questions, bug reports, or feature requests, please use the [WordPress Support Forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/tablepress). Please [search](http://wordpress.org/support/) through the forums first, and only [open a new thread](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/tablepress) if you don't find an existing answer. Thank you!

= Requirements? =

In short: WordPress 3.5 or higher, while the latest version of WordPress is always recommended.

= Languages and Localization? =

The plugin currently includes the following languages:
English and German.

I'd really appreciate it, if you would translate the plugin into your language! Using Heiko Rabe's WordPress plugin [Codestyling Localization](http://www.code-styling.de/english/development/wordpress-plugin-codestyling-localization-en/) that really is as easy as pie. Just install the plugin, add your language, create the .po-file, translate the strings in the comfortable editor and create the .mo-file. It will automatically be saved in TablePress's plugin folder. If you send me the .mo- and .po-file, I will gladly include them into future plugin releases.
There is also a .pot-file available to use in the "i18n" subfolder. Of course you can also use [poEdit](http://www.poedit.net/) as your editor, which also works nicely.

= Where can I get more information? =

Please visit the [official plugin website](http://tablepress.org/) for the latest information on this plugin.

== Usage ==

After installing the plugin, you can add, import, export, edit, copy, delete, ... tables via the "TablePress" screen in your admin menu in the WordPress Dashboard.
Everything should be self-explaining there.

To show one of your tables in a post, on a page, or in a text widget, just include the Shortcode `[table id=&lt;the-id&gt; /]` to your post/page/text widget, where `&lt;the-id&gt` is the ID of your table (can be found on the left side of the "All Tables" screen.)

After that you might want to change the styling of the table. You can do this by entering CSS commands into the "Custom CSS" textarea on the "Plugin Options" screen.
You may also add certain features (like sorting, pagination, filtering, alternating row colors, row highlighting, print name and/or description, ...) by checking the appropriate options on the "Edit table" screen.
